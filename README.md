## Surrogation Game for oTree

This is a surrogation game for oTree inspired by the experimental setting presented in Choi, Hecht, and Tayler (2012) in The Accounting Review and in Choi, Hecht, and Tayler (2013) in Journal of Accounting Research.

In the surrogation game, participants chooses to distribute 100 skill points to five different skill dimensions to generate a character. 
Participants are informed on beforehand that they can allocate their skill points any way they like.
Participants' propensity to exhibit surrogation can be measured by informing half of the participants on beforehand that one skill dimension will be measured.
The application can be used by researchers interested in eliciting surrogation, and it can be extended to examine the determinants and consequences of surrogation.
